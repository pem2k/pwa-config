## Installation

To install this project, clone the repository, and run the command npm i to install required dependencies. Once that's complete, build and run the project with the command "npm start".

## Usage

Once the installation steps are complete, and the application is running, you can use JATE as a text editor. All typed content will be saved to the browsers indexed db when the dom loses focus.
